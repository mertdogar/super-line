# chat-supervisor's terminal cockpit

The [chat-supervisor example](/examples/#chat-supervisor-a-human-and-an-ai-agent-co-edit-a-canvas)
has **three faces on one server**: the web app, a full **terminal cockpit**, and a
[headless line protocol](/how-to/chat-headless). This page is the terminal story — the same
channel, the same streaming delegation cards, and the same live sticky-note canvas, rendered with
[OpenTUI](https://github.com/sst/opentui) in your terminal.

![The TUI cockpit live: the supervisor delegates, the editor's sticky notes land on the canvas pane, and the human nudges them from the keyboard](/chat-supervisor-tui.gif)

A crisp still of the same flow: [full-resolution screenshot](/chat-supervisor-tui.png). Both are
reproducible — the example checks in the `vhs` tape and the `captureSpans`-based screenshot script.

## The point: the hooks don't care about the DOM

The cockpit is deliberately **not** a second client implementation. It mounts the exact providers
and hooks the web app uses — `<SuperLineAuthProvider>` (plugin-auth), `createChatHooks` (plugin-chat),
`createSuperLineHooks` — under `@opentui/react`'s custom reconciler. `useMessages` streams the
delegation tree into bordered cards, `useChannelResources` finds the channel's canvas and doc,
`useResourcePresence` draws the `◉` viewer line, and the native `useDoc`-style handle writes your
drags and edits back — none of it knows it's rendering to a terminal framebuffer instead of the
DOM. If you're evaluating whether super-line's react layer survives outside a browser: this is the
proof, running against a live server in CI (`src/tui/smoke.tsx`).

## What the terminal keeps from the web UI

- **The canvas is spatial, not a list.** Notes render as colored boxes at their **true web
  coordinates** (scaled), so when the agent — or a browser user — moves a note, it moves *here*.
  Overlap is allowed on purpose; selecting brings a note to front. Mouse click-selects and drags;
  `m` + arrows nudges without a mouse.
- **Delegation cards stream live**, reasoning as a dim `think` prefix, tool calls with state
  glyphs — the same part model as the web feed, folded by the same `parent`-nesting logic.
- **One keyboard owner at a time** (a pattern ported from the
  [super-harness TUI](https://github.com/mertdogar/super-harness)): the prompt owns keys; **Tab on
  an empty prompt** hands them to the pane; a dialog takes them while open. `/` opens the command
  popover; `↑` recalls history; `Shift+Enter` inserts a newline.
- **Login is real** plugin-auth email/password (register on first run), with the access token
  cached to `~/.chat-supervisor-tui.json` — restarts reconnect silently, and the
  [headless shell](/how-to/chat-headless) reuses the same file.

## Run it

```bash
pnpm install                        # repo root
cd examples/chat-supervisor
echo 'AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=…' > .env
pnpm dev            # server + web — then, in another terminal:
pnpm tui            # requires bun (OpenTUI uses bun:ffi)
```

Open the web app and the TUI side by side, drag a note in one, and ask the supervisor to
*"add a note for each launch task"* from either — every face converges on the same CRDT document.
